If you\u2019re working in Illustrator, to use your example, they will only see that you were using illustrator at the time you used it. They CAN see your file system, but they can\u2019t go in and open up an Illustrator project to look at it or anything like that. \n\nYour passwords are safe, they can\u2019t see what they are. But if your company is installing this stuff you might want to start using a password manager if you aren\u2019t already if you want extra security. If you\u2019re saving your passwords in a browser on a work machine, that would be more of a concern than anything jamf can do when it comes to your passwords.\n\nThey can\u2019t see your banking, etc. It\u2019s not an active monitoring software (as in: no one can just see your screen whenever they wish, only a timeline of general actions). It\u2019s made to give IT a general idea of what your machine has been running, not exactly what it is you\u2019re doing in those programs.",

But I would agree with others here that it's unlikely, unless HR or Legal Dept or whoever says.\n\nDetecting if you plug in an external drive - Yes, in terms of knowing if it happened. Viruses and malware being on USB Drives is a pretty common approach, so security software is often tasked to detect/block/manage the use of external flash drives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way I would treat it is that anything on the computer *could* be viewed, if it became really important to the company to do dig it up. If they're showing you a printout and it's something that you could not possibly explain to your boss and keep your job...\n\nIf they really really really needed to know what the banner you made for your niece in Illustrator on your lunch break looked like, they could probably get to that. Someone would go digging. And as a longtime IT person, that's a thing that happens because our boss told us to. Period. We're busy, not bored. And we don't want to get in trouble, so we don't poke around for giggles.\n\nI would encourage you not to save passwords, tie the computer to your personal iCloud, etc. That's comingling data that neither party wants commingled. If nothing else, chances that **you** gets compromised goes up, because it's way more likely someone is targeting Acme Inc. than you personally on your home computer. And now your identity info is caught up as collateral.\n\nNow, I'm not an HR person. Your employee handbook could have rules that are way stricter than the technical stuff.

I can tell you, I hate everything about it. \n\nAlso, be prepared for Apple to completely change how they do everything every few years. It's a roller coaster. \n\nA mixed Apple/PC environment is rough for the backend of things. Apple wants everything to be 1:1 user/device. Their devices are NOT Enterpeise friendly, and despite their historical position, Apple seems to hate the education and enterprise enviroments. JAMF is there to help you wrangle Apple devices into compliance.  \n\nI was \"The Mac guy\" in my IT shop for 10 years. \n\nThe best advice I have is....save your company an ENORMOUS amount of money and ditch Apple. The devices are over-priced, and you need a 3rd party MDM to make them compliant, which is also a cost expenditure. You also expend an inordinate amount of time maintaining and enforcing polices on staff that won't like how it much it locks down their Apple devices. \n\nLastly....good luck.",

From the automated remediation perspective, nothing beats Jamf Pro and Jamf Protect, which is fully integrated for sub minute response. Aside from that, Kandji has limited runway in terms of financing and funding from investors. They are literally on a cash burn without any solid plans for the future. I wouldn't bet my career on a company that might go bust anytime soon.",

One of the execs had been in contact with Kandji already who had been pitching they were a cheaper option so we reached out and setup a trial. I was very clear the only reason we were considering moving was price.\n\nAlthough I was impressed with Kandji and we were able to replicate about 60% of what we use JAMF for in the first week of trail, they still hadn't given us a quote. They had asked if they could see what we were paying for JAMF before quoting us and that seemed a bit shady. Like a plumbing contractor wanting to see your other bids before quoting a job. We figured they had standard pricing, but depending on the number of clients and perhaps multi year contracts they could give us a lower than standard pricing. Well, this morning they finally gave us our quote after we told them we weren't comfortable showing what we were paying for JAMF first. It was more than we currently pay for JAMF AND that included a 20% discount if we signed up quickly.\n\nI can't think of any other company we deal with that tries to price this way.\n\nThey quoted us mid $30,000s for 400 system and that doesn't include their end point protection.\n\nAnyone out there mind sharing what they currently pay for Kandji and how many seats? The sales rep told me they've seen people paying between $4/seat/month for JAMF up to $14/seat/\n\nJamf pro's standard pricing is $7/seat/month right now for just the MDM, so I'm not sure where he's getting numbers higher than that unless that includes extra Jamf services that we don't have and were never part of our conversation.\n\nComments on here seemed mostly positive and everyone seemed to indicate they were substantially less expensive.",

        "body": "We switched from Jamf Cloud with Connect to Kandji two months ago. So far we absolutely love it. To us, Jamf was a toolbox whereas Kandji was ready to use out of the box. We love the layout and readability of the console, even the creature comforts like being able to see details about a blueprint item without having to go to the library whereas Jamf would require you to open another tab to compare two pages. The things visible to the user, such as Passport and the agent, have a much nicer appearance and appear to belong in macOS, unlike Jamf.\n\nWe had our demo environment doing great in one week. Most of our profiles were recreated and configured within a week. We find Passport to be more reliable and user-friendly than Connect. Liftoff has worked perfectly. The user agent does well to inform the user of updates or actions needed.\n\nWe actually migrated at a fast pace. Our Jamf contract was ending two weeks from the day we signed with Kandji, and since they don't let you test the migration tool we risked it.\n\nWe had one major migration hurdle: Jamf was deploying Wi-Fi via a config profile. As soon as Kandji forced Jamf to unenroll a device it would lose the office Wi-Fi connection and the device was stranded because the deletion of the config profile removed the active SSID. To mitigate, we started a temporary Wi-Fi network, pushed it as a script, and then the Kandji migration tool would wait long enough for the device to see the temp network and connect.\n\nWe made it! Before Jamf expired we sent all remaining devices (there weren't many) an MDM unenroll command from Jamf. In Apple Business Manager we pointed all devices to Kandji. Then those devices could do sudo profiles -N to re-enroll based on what Apple Business Manager pointed them to.\n\nKandji's use of rules on blueprint items means we only need a few blueprints. We chose to do one blueprint for production, one for conference room equipment, and one for secured special devices. Other blueprints can be used for testing.\n\nKandji Prism is a new search feature that works well.\n\nIt's nice that Kandji licenses users instead of devices. We can now enroll iPads, iPhones, and Apple TVs along with Macs.\n\nI do have to give Kandji one F grade: You're assigned a migration specialist at the start. This is who provides your custom migration script. In our case the specialist only responded to us about once a day no matter how urgent. They also said more than once that they had added colleagues to our case but we never heard from anyone else. On the flip side, chat support and their documentation has been great.\n\nIf you are looking for something that works well from the start, Kandji is not a bad choice. I'm looking forward to full Platform SSO authentication support next year. (Giving it time in the oven.) Apple is still polishing it and Kandji supports it but we want to let them work any bugs out.",

Potentially automatically isolating a compromised device from a network, though that would not be applicable for my situation (cloud-based environment), and ideally, the EDR would quarantine the malicious file or process before executing and compromising the device.
